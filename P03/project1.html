        <p > The goal of this project was to create a fully responsive website for a hypothetical store in collaboration with a
          partner coding on GitHub. Myself and my partner created the company “LA REB DESIGN STUDIOS” that sold design prints. We
          created a moodboard of inpiration for our brand’s colour palette and typefaces  and inspirations for the final website.
          To ensure consistency with our website’s elements we created a styleguide that held example HTML code for elements such
          as buttons, form comments and product listings. We implemented the styleguide’s elements with HTML and CSS code to create
          templates  for product listings, checkout pages, an about/contact page, and  a homepage.  To create the completed pages
          we implemented real content, such as product pictures and product/company descriptions.
        </p>
        <p > My partner and I struggled to create a web experience that was easy for the user to navigate. We were unsure how
          to utilize a responsive interface to allow the user to know what was clickable and understand the purpose behind the
          site’s elements. To solve this issue we asked others to test run our website given a specific task (for example, open
          the site and navigate adding a product to the cart and checking out) and narrate their thought process outloud.
          This way we were able to see where buttons or more interaction feedback needed to be added for users to understand
          the site, and make navigating the site easier, and requiring less moving back and forth between pages. As a result
          our UI became more user-friendly and created a more pleasant experience.
