        <p > In a group of three, we were tasked with creating a mobile application for users 75 years and older, based on
          thorough user research and testing. My group created an app that assisted elderly users with remembering personal tasks,
          events and symptoms to report to their caretakers and or doctors. The process started by researching articles that
          discussed the needs of elderly users when using mobile apps, before making a persona based on that research. As a
          group we decided that it would be useful to create an app that allowed users to create reminders, access a calendar and
          tracked their daily symptoms, all in one place. We created a styleguide including a colour palette and typeface that is
          highly visible for elderly users and created wireframes. We used Protopie to create a functioning prototype to use for
          user testing. We conducted user tests with our desired audience age range and received feedback before applying
          necessary changes.
        </p>
        <p > We had difficulty implementing features that were highly visible for users and easy to interact with on mobile.
          During our user tests we realized that some elements were too small for users to press if their hands are less mobile,
          and we were unsure how to design bigger elements in a way that still looked nice. It was difficult for us to leave
          behind what we were used to designing, such as small minimalistic elements. To fix this issue we did more research on
          effective methods for assisting elderly users on mobile apps. I would definitely try to create a concept for an app
          that went beyond healthcare or memory loss, as many of my peers created apps that had the same concept as AgeWell.
