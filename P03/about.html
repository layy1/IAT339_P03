<h2>Meet the <mark><i>Designer</i></mark></h2>
  <p>
I am a designer currently studying Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University to achieve my Bachelor of Arts. I have an interest in user
interface and experience design, and making unique and intuitive experiences. I believe that collaboration, creativity and
adequate research are the key ingredients needed to create successful, user-friendly applications. Through my schooling and
other opportunities I have exercised my visual design, user-research, user-testing and programming skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    Being a student I am constantly learning and seeking new opportunities to grow my experiences and skillset. In my
    future career I want to work in a company that allows me to develop and grow my skills and seize new opportunities.
