      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p >
          The goal of this project was to create a fully responsive website for a hypothetical store in collaboration with a partner coding in
           GitHub. My partner and I created the company “LA REB DESIGN STUDIOS” that sold design prints and created an online storefront.
        </p>
        <h3>Process Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          We created a moodboard of inspiration for our brand’s colour palette and typefaces and inspirations for the final website. I researched other
          websites and photos of other web layouts for inspiration and created our potential colour palettes. To ensure consistency with our website’s
          elements we created a styleguide that held example HTML code for elements such as buttons, form comments and product listings. We implemented
          the styleguide’s elements with HTML and CSS code to create templates for product listings, checkout pages, an about/contact page, and a
          homepage. I coded a majority of the HTML code of the project , as our base code was code I had created for a previous project, and implemented
          the new styling with my partner through GitHub. To create the completed pages we implemented real content, such as product pictures and
          product/company descriptions, I found the images of example products (making sure our images were consistent and matched our chosen colour
          palette)
          and wrote the product descriptions and company bio.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Conflicts and Solutions</h3>
        <p>
          My partner and I struggled to create a web experience that was easy for the user to navigate. I was unsure how to utilize a responsive
          interface to allow the user to know what was clickable and understand the purpose behind the site’s elements. To solve this issue we asked
          others to test run our website given a specific task (for example, I asked the participants I gathered to open the site and navigate adding
          a product to the cart and checking out) and narrate their thought process aloud. This way I could see where buttons or more interaction
          feedback needed to be added for users to understand the site, and make navigating the site easier, and requiring less moving back and forth
          between pages. As a result our UI became more user-friendly and created a more pleasant experience that was enjoyed by users.
